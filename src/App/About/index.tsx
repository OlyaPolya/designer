        My name is Vitalya Polyansky.
        <br /> I am senior designer specializing in HTML5 display ads and 2D animation â€” with 16 years experience. <br />
        I've had the pleasure of working on master-animations for many of Top100 USA brands, TV Channels and AAA+ games (under NDA). <br />
        Also have solid experience of regular long-term work on huge ad campaigns (300+ creatives). I always work accurately, with very quick turnaround.
